                Hi there! I’m Tara, the proud owner of Body Designs. I have been a professional tattoo artist since 2003
                and specialize in a wide range of
                styles.
                What I value most about my work is the opportunity to create lasting art that commemorates meaningful
                moments in people’s lives.
                I look forward to collaborating with you to bring your ideas to life and helping you express your true

                Hey, I’m Phil, a tattoo artist at Body Designs. I began my career as a graphic designer and
                illustrator at the age of 13, working
                with clients such as Marvel and Nickelodeon.
                For over a decade, I’ve brought my artistic background, love of pop culture, and passion for lowbrow art
                into tattooing.
                Whether black and grey or full color, I enjoy transforming ideas into tattoos that come to life!

                Hi, I’m Jade, the newest addition to Body Designs. I began my apprenticeship in September 2024 after
                graduating from Purchase College with a degree in printmaking.
                While I enjoy exploring a variety of tattoo styles, my main focus is on black and grey work.
                Outside of tattooing, I love playing video games such as <em>Bloodborne</em> and <em>Diablo</em>, and
                I’m an avid manga fan, with <em>Berserk</em> being my favorite.
